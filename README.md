# Will you be using new types of data?

*[Data Stewardship Wizard] Question - additional resources*

Short UID: ikk

## The Question

Sometimes the type of data you collect can not be stored in a commonly used data format. In such cases you may need to make your own, keeping interoperability as high as possible.

### Possible answers:

  * No, all of my data will fit in common formats 
  * Yes, I will need to use custom formats for some of my data
